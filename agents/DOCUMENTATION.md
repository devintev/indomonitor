# Framework Documentation References & Development Guidelines
Each entry in the library list needs to have a Framework / Library name, a version of which this library is used, a url reference to documentation (html pages or llm.txt or llm-full.txt) and where possible the context7CompatibleLibraryID.

## Framework and Library References
- [Framework/Library Name]: Version: x.x.x, context7CompatibleLibraryID: `/websites/example_url/docu_id`, Website: https://example.com/docs, LLM.txt: https://example.com/llm.txt,
- [Library Name]: Version: x.x.x, context7CompatibleLibraryID: `/websites/example_url/docu_id`, Notes: [key usage notes]
- [Add additional frameworks and libraries as needed]
